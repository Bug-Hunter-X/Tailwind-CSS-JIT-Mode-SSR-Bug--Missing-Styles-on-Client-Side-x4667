This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The issue is that Tailwind's JIT mode generates CSS classes based on the classes actually used in your components.  During SSR, only the classes used on the server are generated. If a component renders different classes on the client-side, they won't be included in the initial CSS, leading to missing styles. This typically manifests as elements that are missing styles or have unexpected display behavior in the browser after the initial render.
