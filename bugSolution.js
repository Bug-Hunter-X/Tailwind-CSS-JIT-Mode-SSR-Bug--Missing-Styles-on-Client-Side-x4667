The solution involves ensuring that all the required Tailwind classes are present during both server-side and client-side rendering.  A common technique is to use a conditional rendering strategy, so that all the classes are potentially available on the server side, even if they might not be actually used.  This might include using a helper function or state management solution.

Here's an example using conditional rendering to ensure the classes are considered during server-side rendering, even if their actual usage might depend on the client-side state. This example is simplistic, and the implementation specifics might vary greatly depending on the framework:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
function MyComponent({ someClientSideProp }) {
  const hasClientSideClass = someClientSideProp; // Example client-side prop

  return (
    <div className={`bg-gray-100 ${hasClientSideClass ? 'text-blue-500' : ''} p-4`}>
      {/* Content */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This ensures that the `text-blue-500` class is considered during the server-side render (even if someClientSideProp is false, and even if `text-blue-500` is not directly used on the server side) preventing the issue. This solution will vary depending on your specific needs and project setup.
